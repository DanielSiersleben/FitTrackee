This application allows you to track your sports activity from gpx files and keep your data on your own server.

Examples (for Android):  
* [Runner Up](https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup) (GPL v3)  
* [ForRunners](https://github.com/brvier/ForRunners)  (GPL v3)  
* [AlpineQuest](https://www.alpinequest.net/) (Proprietary, [exodus privay report](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/reports/2975/))  

Maps are displayed using [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

**Still under development (not ready for production).**
